Goals:
- learn about classes
     - call functions from class
     - access data stored in class
- learn how to use github
     - fork
     - push
     - pull
     - pull request
 

Intro to classes: 
 
 what are they?
 classes are the way that we create objects in c++ (and other object oriented languages)

 example:
 class "school" can store information sunch as "students", "teachers". It may have functions to add or remove a student or a teacher.

 classes and functions in each class are declared in a header .h file. They are then defined in a .cpp file. 
 this means our class "school" and function "add_teacher" would be in the .h file and the logic for actually adding the teacher would be in
 the .cpp file



intro to GitHub:

 github is a version control system. it allows multiple people to work on 1 project without major conflicts.

 fork - when working on something, you make a fork so that you do not touch the globally used file. this is because mistakes happen and 
 you dont want to mess up the file that everyone else is working on

 pull - pulling from github moves the version of the code online to your personal computer

 commit / push - when you finish any amount of work that you want to save, you commit your work and add a message. for example:
 "created school class". once your work is commited, you do a git push to send your work to github (make sure in correct fork)
